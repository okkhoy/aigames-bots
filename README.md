# Python bot for warlight AI challenge (conquest-engine)

A test bot for theaigames/conquest-engine (warlight challenge).
This is a simple bot that searches the neighbors and attacks if there is any neutral land.
No fancy logic in here (at this moment!).

This file will be updated as and when features are added.
