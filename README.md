# Bot for some AI Games competitions

Right now there are two dumb bots: 

* A test bot for theaigames/conquest-engine (warlight challenge).
  * This is a simple bot that searches the neighbors and attacks if there is any neutral land.
  * No fancy logic in here (at this moment!).

* A test bot for theaigames/blocksbattle (tetris game).
  * This is a simple bot that makes random moves. 
  * No planning is involved.

This file will be updated as and when features are added.
